### Tracking Guidelines
- Maintain tracker in shared workspace (Notion/Sheets) linked to this document; sync statuses during weekly stand-ups.
- Assign owners and due dates once the delivery team is finalized; color-code statuses for quick scanning.
- Record dependencies and blockers in the `Notes` column; escalate issues in project syncs.
- Align tracker IDs with issue tracker tickets (e.g., Linear `E2` -> `LIN-102`).
- Review metrics and qualitative feedback post-launch to feed into Growth phase backlog.

### Reporting Cadence
- **Weekly:** Progress summary, key decisions, risks, blockers.
- **Bi-weekly:** KPI review (traffic, leads, conversion rates), analytics insights.
- **Monthly:** Strategic review of content performance, SEO ranking shifts, and pipeline impact.
- **Quarterly:** Roadmap update covering Phase 2/3 initiatives and resource planning.
